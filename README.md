# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to answer several key questions about the pandemic's impact across different countries and continents. By using SQL queries, we can extract meaningful insights from the data, such as infection and death rates, vaccination progress, and the percentage of the population affected by the virus.
